# BlogSite-with-database


Ive built a BlogSite using ejs css javascript node express mongoDb and mongoose 

go to the compose page and compose a blog 
it will then appear on the home page where youll find a clickable read more once you click that you will be taken to another page dedecated just for the post
which ive accomplished using node with express routing parameters and ejs 

Ive also given this blog a database using the fundamentals of mongoDb and mongoose. when you press on the publish button the post will be saved in a database
called blogDB within which there will be a collection called posts in your computer which you can access and modify by using mongoDb 

ive also added a delete button if you want to delete certain posts from the database using  one of the CRUD operations

to use the app
clone to you computer, install all the dependencies which u will find in package.json and then in ur terminal run "node app.js" 
go to localhost:3000 and u will have a beautiful Blog Site with a database.
